# post-express renderer
The <b>post-express renderer</b> (PER for short) is a utility built into post-express. It is responsible for rendering HTML pages, handling data that is passed into it, and loading stylesheets into HTML pages.

The renderer can be loaded from a single TypeScript file (`/index.ts`), and is designed to be a lightweight and reliable rendering engine. It is mostly inspired by EJS (Embedded Javascript), which allows the developer to pass data into an HTML page from the server.
